This is the oojs01 project. Its purpose is to codify basic knowledge
of object-oriented programming in JavaScript to facilitate learning of
that knowledge.

You'll need to install oojs01, the Dojo Toolkit SDK, Ext-JS (Ext-JS
just for one test group), and json2.js under a web server's document
root. Extract, if and as necessary, and put the Dojo Toolkit SDK
(http://downloads.dojotoolkit.org/release-1.5.0/dojo-release-1.5.0-src.tar.gz),
ext-js (http://www.sencha.com/products/js/download.php), and json2.js
(http://www.json.org/json2.js) in the same directory as oojs01. Be
sure to remove or comment-out the first line of json2.js.

When you've got the code installed, you can run it by browsing to
runTests.html, which can be found under oojs01/code/tests/ .

Please let me know how far you get and what you think.

The code was written for Firefox and hasn't been completely fixed for
other browsers yet. You might want to use Firefox's Firebug
plugin. You also might want to try Multifirefox, which allows you to
use different Firefox profiles simultaneously. I use Sun's free
VirtualBox on my Mac to test things under Internet Explorer.
