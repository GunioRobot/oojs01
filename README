This project's purpose is to learn, teach, and codify basic knowledge of object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

You'll need to install the code under a web server's document root, and you'll need to download the Dojo Toolkit SDK (http://downloads.dojotoolkit.org/release-1.5.0/dojo-release-1.5.0-src.tar.gz) and install it to match the symbolic link in my code. As of today, the symbolic link points to Dojo 1.5.0. If you use a different version of the SDK, adjust the link accordingly. 
When you've got the code installed, you can run it by browsing to runTests.html.

Please let me know how far you get and what you think.

The code was written for Firefox and hasn't been fixed for other browsers yet. You might want to use Firefox's Firebug plugin. You also might want to try Multifirefox, which allows you to use different Firefox profiles simultaneously. I use Sun's free VirtualBox on my Mac to test things under Internet Explorer.
